# Dart

### 1. Functions

#### 1. Named Functions

#### 2. Anonymous Functions

* Anonymous functions are like named functions but they don't have a **name.** They like [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) functions in Javascript.
* Syntax:

`(parameters list) {`

`statement(s)`

`}`&#x20;
